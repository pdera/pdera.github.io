<h2><a name="news0004">CDAC approves funding for our group for 2016-2017 academic year</a></h2>
The CDAC-supported project at the University of Hawaii started on September 1, 2013. This proposal request renewal 
of funding for the fourth year. Currently two Ph.D. students are supported by this project, each at 50%: Yi Hu 
(B.Sc. from University of Science and Technology of China, major in geophysics, started the Ph.D. program at UH in August 2013) 
and Hanna Shelton (B.Sc. from University of Hawaii, major in chemistry, started the Ph.D. program on September 1, 2014). Since 
the beginning of the project our efforts have been focused on training the students in high-pressure techniques, sample preparation, 
principles of high-pressure X-ray crystallography and data analysis and crystallographic computations.

The application of pressure on [CoII(dpzca)2], which at ambient pressure undergoes abrupt spin crossover(SCO) 
with thermal hysteresis, gives unique insights into SCO. It reversibly separates the crystallographicphase transition 
(I41/a↔P21/c) and associated abrupt SCO from the underlying gradual SCO, as shownby detailed room temperature (RT) 
X-ray crystallography and temperature dependent magnetic suscepti-bility studies, both under a range of 10 different 
pressures. The pressure effects are shown to be reversible.The crystal structure of the pressure-induced low-spin state 
is determined at RT at 0.42(2) and 1.78(9)GPa. At the highest pressure [1.78(9) GPa] the Co–N bond lengths are consistent 
with the complex beingfully LS, and the conjugated terdentate ligands are significantly distorted out of plane. 
The abrupt SCOevent can be shifted up to RT by application of a hydrostatic pressure of 0.4 GPa. These magnetic sus-ceptibility 
(vs.temperature) and X-ray crystallography (at RT) studies, under a range of pressures, showthat the SCO can be tuned over a wide 
range of temperature and pressure space, including RT SCO.
