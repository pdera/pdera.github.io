The CDAC-supported project at the University of Hawaii started on September 1, 2013. This proposal request renewal 
of funding for the fourth year. Currently two Ph.D. students are supported by this project, each at 50%: Yi Hu 
(B.Sc. from University of Science and Technology of China, major in geophysics, started the Ph.D. program at UH in August 2013) 
and Hanna Shelton (B.Sc. from University of Hawaii, major in chemistry, started the Ph.D. program on September 1, 2014). Since 
the beginning of the project our efforts have been focused on training the students in high-pressure techniques, sample preparation, 
principles of high-pressure X-ray crystallography and data analysis and crystallographic computations.

</div>

X-ray Atlas instrument, being developed within the NSF EAR Instrumentation and Facilities project through 
acquisition of Bruker D8 Venture/D8 Advance system and further customization, will create a novel state of 
the art solution for in situ laboratory-based single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction experiments at the University of Hawaii. 
The new instrument system will be capable of exploring pressure-temperature conditions relevant for the Earth upper mantle, 
transition zone and some of the lower mantle. X-ray Atlas will create new and very exciting opportunities for lab-based mineralogy, 
petrology and mineral physics undergraduate and graduate research and education, and will serve as personnel training and new technology 
prototyping site for HIGP-lead projects at Argonne National Laboratory.

The application of pressure on 	CoII(dpzca)2, which at ambient pressure undergoes abrupt spin crossover(SCO) 
with thermal hysteresis, gives unique insights into SCO. It reversibly separates the crystallographicphase transition 
(I41/a↔P21/c) and associated abrupt SCO from the underlying gradual SCO, as shownby detailed room temperature (RT) 
X-ray crystallography and temperature dependent magnetic suscepti-bility studies, both under a range of 10 different 
pressures. The pressure effects are shown to be reversible.The crystal structure of the pressure-induced low-spin state 
is determined at RT at 0.42(2) and 1.78(9)GPa. At the highest pressure of 1.78(9) GPa the Co–N bond lengths are consistent 
with the complex beingfully LS, and the conjugated terdentate ligands are significantly distorted out of plane. 
The abrupt SCOevent can be shifted up to RT by application of a hydrostatic pressure of 0.4 GPa. These magnetic sus-ceptibility 
(vs.temperature) and X-ray crystallography (at RT) studies, under a range of pressures, showthat the SCO can be tuned over a wide 
range of temperature and pressure space, including RT SCO.

<h2><a name="news0001">Paper about hydrous wadsleyite and ringwoodite in the transition zone by Yin-Yuan Chang et al. published in JGR</a></h2>
<div class="floatleft">

Review of recent mineral physics literature shows consistent trends for the influence of Fe and H2O on the bulk modulus (K0) of 
wadsleyite and ringwoodite, the major phases of Earth's mantle transition zone (410–660km). However, there is little consensus on the first 
pressure derivative, K0′=(dK/dP)P=0, which ranges from about 4 to >5 across experimental studies and compositions. Here we demonstrate the 
importance of K0′ in evaluating the bulk sound velocity of the transition zone in terms of water content and provide new constraints on 
the effect of H2O on K0′ for wadsleyite and ringwoodite by conducting a comparative compressibility study. In the experiment, multiple 
crystals of hydrous Fo90 wadsleyite containing 2.0 and 0.25 wt% H2O were loaded into the same diamond anvil cell, along with hydrous ringwoodite 
containing 1.4 wt% H2O. By measuring their pressure-volume evolution simultaneously up to 32GPa, we constrain the difference in K0′ 
independent of the pressure scale, finding that H2O has no effect on K0′, whereas the effect of H2O on K0 is significant. The fitted K0′ 
values of hydrous wadsleyite (0.25 and 2.0 wt% H2O) and hydrous ringwoodite (1.4 wt% H2O) examined in this study were found to be identical 
within uncertainty, with K0′ ~3.7(2). New secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements of the H2O content of these and previously investigated 
wadsleyite samples shows the bulk modulus of wadsleyite is reduced by 7.0(5) GPa/wt% H2O, independent of Fe content for upper mantle compositions.
Because K0′ is unaffected by H2O, the reduction of bulk sound velocity in very hydrous regions of transition zone is expected to be on the order 
of 1.6%, which is potentially detectible in high-resolution, regional seismology studies.

<h2><a name="news0006">Paper about thermal equation of state of bridgmanite by Aaron Wolf et al. published in JGR</a></h2>
<div class="floatleft">
<img src="images/wolf15fig9.jpg" width="200">
</div>
The high-pressure/high-temperature equation of state (EOS) of synthetic 13% Fe-bearing bridgmanite (Mg silicate perovskite) 
is measured using powder X-ray diffraction in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell with a quasi-hydrostatic neon pressure medium. 
We compare these results, which are consistent with previous 300 K sound speed and compression studies, with a reanalysis of 
Fe-free Mg end-member data from Tange et al. (2012) to determine the effect of iron on bridgmanite's thermoelastic properties. 
EOS parameters are incorporated into an ideal lattice mixing model to probe the behavior of bridgmanite at deep mantle conditions. 
With this model, a nearly pure bridgmanite mantle composition is shown to be inconsistent with density and compressibility profiles
of the lower mantle. We also explore the buoyant stability of bridgmanite over a range of temperatures and compositions expected 
for Large Low-Shear Velocity Provinces, concluding that bridgmanite-dominated thermochemical piles are more likely to be passive 
dense layers externally supported by convection, rather than internally supported metastable domes. The metastable dome scenario 
is estimated to have a relative likelihood of only 4–7%, given the narrow range of compositions and temperatures consistent with 
seismic constraints. If buoyantly supported, such structures could not have remained stable with greater thermal contrast early 
in Earth's history, ruling out formation scenarios involving a large concentration of heat producing elements.
