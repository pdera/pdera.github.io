<h2><a name="news0004">CDAC approves funding for our group for 2016-2017 academic year</a></h2>
The CDAC-supported project at the University of Hawaii started on September 1, 2013. This proposal request renewal 
of funding for the fourth year. Currently two Ph.D. students are supported by this project, each at 50%: Yi Hu 
(B.Sc. from University of Science and Technology of China, major in geophysics, started the Ph.D. program at UH in August 2013) 
and Hanna Shelton (B.Sc. from University of Hawaii, major in chemistry, started the Ph.D. program on September 1, 2014). Since 
the beginning of the project our efforts have been focused on training the students in high-pressure techniques, sample preparation, 
principles of high-pressure X-ray crystallography and data analysis and crystallographic computations.
